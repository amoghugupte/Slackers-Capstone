    "This data set is uploaded in order to get the insights of Credit card Defaultees based on the respective attributes. \n",
    "The consumer lending line of business @ JPMC is in the business of lending money to customers for loans, credit cards, mortgage, etc. and a model like this which can predict potential defaults would be immensely helpful in making lending decisions. The aim of the project is to provide this service, based on a ML model, which will be repeatable, scallable and retrainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Set\n",
    "Data set is from Kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/mishra5001/credit-card\n",
    "\n",
    "Source:\n",
    "\n",
    "International Institute of Information Technology Bangalore\n",
    "\n",
    "The Data was collected as part of Social Experiment to provide public inferences of how a person applying for Loan can get it completed in a minimal amount of time. Also, adhering to the facts as which type of customers fail to repay the installments or full loan and provide inference so that the person applying for loan does not falls into that category.\n",

    "#### Motive!\n",
    "\n",
    "This data set is uploaded in order to get the insights of Credit card Defaultees based on the respective attributes!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Inside?\n",
    "\n",
    "We have attributes such as IncomeTotal,AMTAPPLICATION,AMT_CREDIT and around 122 Columns in Application Data Set. The interesting thing is if you intend to see the patterns and variations, we can use the PREVIOUS APPLICATION data set also, in order to get more insights.!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Inspiration\n",
    "We took this data set as our assignment and tried to perform the EDA to the best of our capability!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution approach\n",
    "This is a supervised classification problem since we are using existing features and target variable to first train the model on a subset of data and then evaluate the model's performance on the test data. We would pick the model that best meets the criteria of accuracy and performance. We are trying to predict if a loan request from a customer will default.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Value to JP Morgan\n",
    "The consumer lending line of business @ JPMC is in the business of lending money to customers for loans, credit cards, mortgage, etc. and a model like this which can predict potential defaults would be immensely helpful in making lending decisions, Also help JPMC to identify and train their customers for credit discipline.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Aim of the project\n",
    "Use the data to come up with a classification model, to approve or reject the application. Eventually build a scalable, repeatable service to give live classification decisions.\n",
